# MicroManger

This is a short game made for the prompt "micro manger", which I will take in a vareity of directions depending what I feel like.

## Journey 
### 27/06/2024
Starting the project, micro manager makes me think about micro organisms, evolution, optimisation and resource management. attempting all of these will be far too complex. 

My first idea is a space-invaders esque game where the ammo is provided by a industry that requires user input. Thus the player must switch between dealing with internal and external threats.

In keeping with the "micro" theme I could style it after a cell, but we will we how we go.
